# Odoo Initializer Add-on

### Introduction
This add-on aims at providing a configuration layer to let implementers start an Odoo server with a given set of pre-loaded settings and metadata, that is versioned controlled.

Settings and metadata will be loaded onto the Odoo server based on what is provided in the data files.

Those data files are mostly in CSV and XML formats, depending of the model that is loaded.

They are processed when the add-on is installed.

### Supported models:

See below the list of supported models:
- [Company Property (CSV)](./readme/company_property.md)
- [Drug (CSV)](./readme/drug.md)
- [Fiscal Position (CSV)](./readme/fiscal_position.md)
- [Journal (CSV)](./readme/journal.md)
- [Payment (CSV)](./readme/payment_term.md)
- [Price List (CSV)](./readme/price_list.md)
- [Stock (CSV)](./readme/stock_location.md)
- [Company (CSV)](./readme/company.md)
- [Partner (CSV)](./readme/partner.md)

### Run add-on tests

Project tests should be run using the following Gradle command:
```
./gradlew clean test
```

Once the tests have run, you may want to run `./gradlew clean` again to make sure all the resources are destroyed (containers, volumes, folders)

### Run the tests and let the Odoo server running
If you are willing to leave the server running after the tests are run, use:
```
./gradlew clean test run
```
The Odoo server will be accessible at http://localhost:8069

### Additional info
The `test` Gradle task will in fact run 2 substasks: **runUnitTests** and **processCSVs**
You can run those 2 tasks independently if you which only run tests partially
```
./gradlew clean runUnitTests
```
```
./gradlew clean processCSVs

```
